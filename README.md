## Building the source

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the
[Installation Instructions](https://github.com/palletone/go-palletone/wiki/Building-palletone)
on the wiki.

Building gptn requires both a Go (version 1.9 or later, newest 1.11 not support) and a C compiler.
You can install them using your favourite package manager.
Once the dependencies are installed, run

```bash
make gptn
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```bash
make all
```

but, to build the full suite of utilities in window,you should:

```bash
go get ./...
go get -u ./...
go build
```

## Executables

The go-palletone project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd` directory.

| Command    | Description |
|:----------:|-------------|
| **`gptn`** | Our main palletone CLI client. It is the entry point into the palletone network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default) archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the palletone network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `gptn --help` and the [CLI Wiki page](https://github.com/palletone/go-palletone/wiki/Command-Line-Options) for command line options. |

## Running gptn

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://github.com/palletone/go-palletone/wiki/Command-Line-Options)), but we've
enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly on how you can run your
own Gptn instance.

### Full node on the main palletone network

By far the most common scenario is people wanting to simply interact with the palletone network:
create accounts; transfer funds; deploy and interact with contracts. For this particular use-case
the user doesn't care about years-old historical data, so we can fast-sync quickly to the current
state of the network. To do so:

```bash
$ mkdir your_dir
$ gptn --datadir="your_dir" newgenesis path/to/your-genesis.json
$ gptn --datadir="your_dir" init path/to/your-genesis.json
$ gptn --datadir="your_dir" --configfile /path/to/your_config.toml
```

This command will:

 * Start gptn in fast sync mode (default, can be changed with the `--syncmode` flag), causing it to
   download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history of the palletone network,
   which is very CPU intensive.
 * Start up Gptn's built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://github.com/palletone/go-palletone/wiki/JavaScript-Console),
   (via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can invoke all official [`web3` methods](https://github.com/palletone/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API)
   as well as Gptn's own [management APIs](https://github.com/palletone/go-palletone/wiki/Management-APIs).
   This too is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running Gptn instance
   with `gptn attach`.


### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `gptn` binary, you can also pass a configuration file via:

```bash
$ gptn --configfile /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get a template configuration file you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to export current default configurations:

```bash
$ gptn dumpconfig /path/to/your_config.toml
```

Open the ` /path/to/your_config.toml ` file in your favorite text editor, and set the field values what you want to change, uncommenting them if necessary.

### Operating a private network

Maintaining your own private network is more involved as a lot of configurations taken for granted in
the official networks need to be manually set up.

#### Defining the private genesis state

First, you'll need to create the genesis state of your networks, which all nodes need to be aware of and agree upon. This consists of a JSON file (e.g. call it `genesis.json`):

You can create a JSON file for the genesis state of a new chain with an existing account or a newly created account named `your-genesis.json` by running this command:

```bash
$ gptn newgenesis path/to/your-genesis.json
```

#### Defining the private mediator parameters

First, you'll need to create the mediator parameters of your networks, which all nodes need to be aware of and agree upon. This consists of a TOML file (e.g. call it `palletone.toml`):

```bash
[MediatorPlugin]
EnableProducing = true
EnableStaleProduction = true
EnableConsecutiveProduction = false

[[MediatorPlugin.Mediators]]
Address = ""
Password = ""
InitPrivKey = ""
InitPubKey = ""
```

Get InitPrivKey and InitPubKey with the following command

```bash
$ gptn mediator initdks
```

InitPrivKey = private key, InitPubKey = public key

When running command `gptn --datadir="your_dir" newgenesis` will create Address and input your password.

##### Customization of the genesis file

If you want to customize the networkâ€™s genesis state, edit the newly created your-genesis.json file. This allows you to control things such as:

* The initial values of chain parameters
* Assets and their initial distribution

With the genesis state defined in the above JSON file, you'll need to initialize **every** Gptn node with it prior to starting it up to ensure all blockchain parameters are correctly set:

```bash
$ gptn init path/to/your-genesis.json
```

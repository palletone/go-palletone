aliceUsePRC20Token
    Given Alice issues her personal token named ALICE, amount is 1000, decimal is 1 succeed
    When Alice transfers 500 ALICE to Bob succeed
    And Bob transfers 200 ALICE to Carol succeed
    And Alice increases 1000 ALICE succeed
    And Alice transfers 500 ALICE to Carol succeed
    Then Alice has 1000 ALICE left
    And Bob has 300 ALICE left
    And Carol has 700 ALICE left
